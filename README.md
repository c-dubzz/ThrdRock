# ThrdRock

Social Media/News Feed solely dedicated to STEM related news

*completed spider structure in headlines -> headlines -> spiders -> headlines_spider.py

I wanted to create an unbiased, social media/news platform that showcases recent tech developments, scientific advancements, 
archeological discoveries, etc. The website will extract the headlines from recently posted articles on high-profile websites and display them all
on the ThrdRock main page. ThrdRock will be able to extract keywords from these headlines and the user will be able to stay up to date on their 
favorite topics by choosing to "follow" various keywords. The user will then be notified when ThrdRock finds a headline with the selected keyword.
